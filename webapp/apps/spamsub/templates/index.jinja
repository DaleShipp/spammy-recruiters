            <p>
            Do you hate it when recruitment agencies send you unsolicited email? We do; it wastes time, attention, and causes unnecessary stress and violent urges.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there's a way around that if you're using Gmail: filters. Simply add the addresses of spammy recruitment agencies, and you'll never see their email again.</p>
            <p>Filters are even better when people collaboratively add addresses to them, because a lot of small contributions can make life easier for everyone. If you've been receiving unwanted email from a recruitment agency, follow the steps, and we'll add them to the list. Don't worry about adding someone we already know about â€“ we'll check immediately, and tell you. We review all submissions, so it might take us a few hours to add a new address.
            </p>
            <p>We've written some brief instructions on how to get started if you aren't using filters yet. You can read them <a href="https://github.com/drcongo/spammy-recruiters#protip">here</a>.</p>
