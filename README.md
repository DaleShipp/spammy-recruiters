Spammy Recruiters
=================

This is a list of UK recruitment companies who have a tendency to send out scattergun spam to digital agencies, in a format for dropping into your Gmail filters.

## Protip ##

Install the Canned Response plugin from Google Labs, create a new filter in your Gmail / Google Apps, paste this list into the From field, and set Gmail to automatically reply with something like this:

    Hi.

    It looks like you're a recruiter and you've sent me an unsolicited email.
    This is an automated response to let you know that it has been flagged as
    spam and deleted without me ever seeing it.

    The same thing will happen to further emails you send me. If this is a 
    mistake and you are actually someone I work with on our recruitment needs
    then you'll have my mobile number, give me a call to let me know.

    Bye.

Make sure to have the filter also flag it as spam and delete it.

##  And finally ##

If you actually use any of the companies in this list, you might want to do two things...

1. Remove them from your filter
2. Think about using a different recruitment company that doesn't spam people.
